# Hi there, I'm Tariq Talat! 👋🚀

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I turn **caffeine** into **code** and ideas into **reality**! 🎯  
I'm a **Computer Vision Engineer** by passion and a **Data Analytics Guru** by profession. 📊🤖  
I forget things faster than my RAM clears cache, so I’m always learning, forgetting, and learning again! 😂
